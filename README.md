# 🚀 Learning AI From Scratch

Welcome to my personal AI learning journey! 🎯

I'm starting with basic knowledge of **Python** and **JavaScript**, and this repository will track my progress as I build projects, take notes, and learn how Artificial Intelligence actually works — all the way to building and understanding **Transformers**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

Most AI tutorials assume a lot of prior knowledge. But here, I'm starting from the very basics:

- 📌 Just started learning Python (not advanced)
- 📌 Know some JavaScript, mostly for web development
- 🧱 Want to _really understand_ how AI models (especially Transformers like ChatGPT) are built

This is a roadmap for **learners like me** who want to go from:

> Basic Python ➡️ Neural Networks ➡️ Deep Learning ➡️ Transformers

## 🗺️ Roadmap: My AI Learning Path

### 🔰 Phase 1: Python Fundamentals for AI

- ✅ Python syntax, data types, loops, functions
- ✅ NumPy & Matplotlib basics
- ✅ Learn about Lists, Arrays, and Matrix Operations (important for neural nets)

📁 `phase-1-python-basics/`

- Mini Project: Matrix Calculator
- Notes: Python Refresher, NumPy Playground

---

### 🔍 Phase 2: Math for AI (Concepts, not Proofs)

- 🔢 Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, Dot Products
- 📐 Calculus: Derivatives & Gradients (for backpropagation)
- 🧮 Probability & Statistics: Mean, Variance, Gaussian Distribution

📁 `phase-2-math-for-ai/`

- Mini Project: Visualizing gradients in Python
- Notes: Hand-drawn math notebooks

---

### 🧠 Phase 3: Building a Neural Network from Scratch

- 🎯 What is a perceptron?
- 🔁 Activation Functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, Softmax
- 🔄 Backpropagation & Training a model

📁 `phase-3-neural-nets/`

- Project: Build a neural network with no libraries
- Bonus: Build the same in JavaScript (for browser visualization)

---

### 📊 Phase 4: Learn with Libraries

- 🧪 Scikit-learn: For simple ML models
- 🔥 PyTorch or TensorFlow: For deep learning
- 🧠 Keras: Easier high-level deep learning

📁 `phase-4-learn-libraries/`

- Project: MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier
- Notes: Comparison between PyTorch vs TensorFlow

---

### 🧬 Phase 5: Understanding Transformers

- 📚 Learn about:
  - Attention Mechanism
  - Self-Attention
  - Positional Encoding
- 🧱 Break down the Transformer architecture (like BERT or GPT)

📁 `phase-5-transformers/`

- Project: Tiny Transformer from Scratch in PyTorch
- Bonus: Visualize attention weights

---

### 🤖 Phase 6: Build AI Projects

- Chatbot with Transformer
- Text Summarizer
- Image Caption Generator
- JS + Python hybrid: Web interface to AI backend

📁 `projects/`

- Code + Explanation for each project

---

## 🔧 Tools I'll Be Using

- Python 🐍
- JavaScript (for front-end + visualizations) 🌐
- Jupyter Notebooks 📓
- VS Code 🧑‍💻
- Git & GitHub 💾
